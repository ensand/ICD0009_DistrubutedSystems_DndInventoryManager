# ICD0009_DistrubutedSystems_DndInventoryManager

###### (Includes the exam files and course project files of ICD0009, taught by professor Andres KÃ¤ver.)
###### (By 'this project' the author means the inventory manager project.)
This project was made for the purpose of learning division of a big .NET project.\
This project has a separate Domain, DAL, BLL and API layer, and a separate ReactJs front-end. Some packages have been published to nuget.\
This project was also published to Azure within docker containers (beckend and frontend separately) but the author has chosen to shut it down to avoid bills.
